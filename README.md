## My process

- Create-React-App
- Restructure my 'src' folder to fit the design
- install React icons
- set up global styles

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
  - BEM Method
  - CSS variables
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

- React icons:

```js (react)
import { FaBeer } from "react-icons/fa";

class Question extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h3>
        {" "}
        Lets go for a <FaBeer />?{" "}
      </h3>
    );
  }
}
```
